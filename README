== TODO AND SUGGESTED FEATURES

- Centralize configuration and make it more flexible. The administration-part of the page can reuse many of the parts used for regular users.
- Rewrite the whole page without use of tables.
- Fix Google Maps HTML validation errors.
- External CSS for all pages.
- Make parts more embed-friendly, e.g. the map and list of registered problems.
- Localization by removing all hardcoded strings and using a translation file (Wordpress-style).
- Do not rely on registerglobals to be set (ref: http://www.odi.ch/prog/design/php/guide.php).
- Installscript for easy setup of database, configuration options and settings.
- Consistent error handling.
- Handle paths in a better way (ABSPATH).
